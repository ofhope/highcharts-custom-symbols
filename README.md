highcharts-custom-symbols
highcharts-custom-symbols is a collection of pre-defined, high-quality SVG-based symbols specifically designed for use with Highcharts. This package aims to extend Highcharts' built-in symbol library with a curated set of icons that are visually prominent and meaningful in various charting contexts.

The symbols are generated from SVG files using a custom conversion script, ensuring optimal rendering and scalability within Highcharts charts.

üöÄ Features
Curated Symbol Sets: Hand-picked icons optimized for clarity and readability in charts.

Easy Integration: Symbols are provided as TypeScript/JavaScript files, ready to be imported and used with Highcharts.

Extensible: Includes a powerful svg-converter.js script, allowing you to convert your own SVG icons into Highcharts symbols.

üì¶ Included Symbol Collections (Current)
At present, the package includes:

Custom Primitives: A set of geometrically precise shapes (e.g., octagons, teardrops) designed to extend Highcharts' basic circle, square, diamond, and triangle symbols.

Transportation Collection: Icons representing various modes of transport, useful for logistics, urban planning, or movement-related data.

üîÆ Upcoming Symbol Collections
We are actively working on expanding the library to include:

Weather Symbols: Icons for meteorological data (e.g., sun, clouds, rain, snow).

People Analytics Symbols: Inclusive and clear icons for demographic and HR-related data (e.g., gender, age groups, roles).

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
(Instructions on how to install your package will go here once it's published to npm or similar.)

# Example (replace with your actual install command)
npm install highcharts-custom-symbols
# or
yarn add highcharts-custom-symbols

üí° Usage
Once installed, you can import and apply these symbols in your Highcharts configuration.

Example: Using a Custom Symbol in a Scatter Plot
import Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import { myCustomOctagonSymbol } from 'highcharts-custom-symbols/symbols/custom-primitives/octagon';
// Or import all symbols from a collection:
// import 'highcharts-custom-symbols/symbols/custom-primitives'; // This will import all symbols from the primitives collection

// Register the symbol with Highcharts (if not imported via index.ts which does it automatically)
// Highcharts.SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols['octagon'] = myCustomOctagonSymbol;

Highcharts.chart('container', {
    series: [{
        type: 'scatter',
        data: [
            { x: 10, y: 5, marker: { symbol: 'octagon' } },
            { x: 20, y: 15, marker: { symbol: 'circle' } }
        ]
    }]
});

Note: When you import from an index.ts file within a symbol collection (e.g., import 'highcharts-custom-symbols/symbols/custom-primitives';), the symbols are automatically registered with Highcharts.SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols. You only need to manually register if you're importing individual symbol files directly.

‚öôÔ∏è Generating Your Own Symbols
The svg-converter.js script included in this project allows you to convert any SVG file into a Highcharts-compatible symbol.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS recommended)

How to Use the Converter
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/highcharts-custom-symbols.git](https://github.com/your-username/highcharts-custom-symbols.git)
cd highcharts-custom-symbols

Run the script:

Convert a single SVG file:

node svg-converter.js path/to/your/icon.svg path/to/output/directory/
# Example:
# node svg-converter.js ./src/svgs/my-icons/star.svg ./symbols/my-icons/

Convert all SVGs in a directory (and its subdirectories):

node svg-converter.js path/to/your/svgs/folder/ path/to/output/directory/
# Example: This will mirror the folder structure from src/svgs/material to symbols/material
# node svg-converter.js ./src/svgs/material/ ./symbols/material/
# Example: This will process all svgs and subdirectories from src/svgs to symbols/
# node svg-converter.js ./src/svgs/ ./symbols/

The script will automatically create output folders and an index.ts file within each folder, importing and re-exporting the generated symbols.
